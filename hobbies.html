                <h3>String Art</h3>
                <p>In my free time I like to be creative - I play with the nails, hammer and threads &#9786;. This is a personal project I started few years ago and I still love doing it.</p>

                <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>It helps me connect with the nature. Because I spend most of my time in front of the computer, on weekends I like to go out and challenge myself with new hiking trails (sometimes dangerous ones &#9786;). I am happy I have friends that share the same hobby with me and we can explore everything together.</p>

                <h3>Basketball</h3>
                <p>It is a great way to relieve stress and boost the mood. It develops strategic thinking and decision-making skills.</p>
